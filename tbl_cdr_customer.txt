--Customer CDR (often referred to as A-leg) are used to create statistics and patterns on the
--customer/ingress attempts. There should be 1 record per customer attempt. Data can be pushed directly 
--into this table. Custom formats can be staged into custom tables but ultimately will be normalized to 
--this structure.

--Customer CDR are only required if youâ€™re using customer-based statistics.

(
    call_time timestamp without time zone NOT NULL, --Required. Start time of the call. Preferably in UTC.
    sip_call_id text NOT NULL, -- Required. Unique SIP call identifier. Also used to join to cdr_carrier if required.
switch_id text not null, --Required. UniqueID on the internal device that received the ingress attempt. The switch IP is perfectly viable as a value.
    tg_id text NOT NULL, --Required. Value that identifies the customer's trunk group.
    ani text, --Optional. Normalized ANI including country code. Required if using our ANI-based statistics.
    dnis text, --Optional. Normalized DNIS including country code. Required if using our DNIS-based statistics.
    lrn text, --Optional. Local Routing Number for the call.
    dnis_lata integer, --Optional. Used for LATA-based statistics. If it is not in your CDR but you have LERG we can dip it from there. 
    dnis_ocn text, --Optional. Used for OCN-based statistics. If it is not in your CDR but you have LERG we can dip it from there. 
dnis_state text, --Optional. Used for State/Province-based statistics. If it is not in your CDR but you have LERG we can dip it from there. 
dnis_clli text, -- Optional. Pronounced "silly". Common Language Location Identifier. If it is not in your CDR but you have LERG we can dip it from there. 
billing_prefix text, --Optional. Prefix the customer was billed on. 
    routing_prefix text, --Optional. Prefix used to route the call. 
    juris text NOT NULL, --Required. https://github.com/rainmandata/networkanalytics-voice/wiki/Jurisdictions
signal_ip text, --Optional. Customer's signaling IP. Only required if using signal IP-based statistics.
media_ip text, --Optional. Customer's media IP. Only required if using media IP-based statistics.
    sip_code text NOT NULL, --Required. Final release cause of the attempt. This is typically a SIP-standard integer value but you can insert internal text-based codes as some networks have custom indicators.
ring_time int, --Optional. Duration of the ring. Seconds or milliseconds based on your preference.
    duration integer, --Optional. Only needed for completed attempts. Leave 0 or null for incomplete attempts.
    duration_billed integer, --Optional. Only needed for completed attempts. Leave 0 or null for incomplete attempts.
    customer_rate numeric(20, 10), --Optional. Only required if Rain Man is being used for financial reporting. If not available in the CDR we can dip it from there customer deck.
    customer_revenue numeric(20, 10), --Optional. Only required if Rain Man is being used for financial reporting. If not available in the CDR we can calculate it using customer_rate/billed_duration.
carrier_tg_id text, --Optional. If you are not sending Rain Man a separate carrier CDR feed then you can include final carrier trunk group here. 
carrier_rate numeric(20, 10), --Optional. If you are not sending Rain Man a separate CDR feed but would like financial reporting include it here.
carrier_cost numeric(20, 10), --Optional. If you are not sending Rain Man a separate CDR feed but would like financial reporting include it here.
pdd int, --Optional. Post Dial Delay as observed by the customer. Seconds or milliseconds based on your preference. Milliseconds recommended.
lcr_depth smallint, --Optional. LCR Depth of the call. Used to identify inefficient routing.
    batch_id text, --Optional. ID to uniquely identify the batch of records. Normally the CDR file names is used. If you do not supply a batch_id then we will generate one using switch_id and timestamp.
id bigserial NOT NULL, --System-generated. Do not supply.
received_time timestamp not null default now() --System-generated. Do not supply.
