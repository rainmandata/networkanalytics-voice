-- FUNCTION: public.fnprocess_cdr_customer()

--DESCRIPTION: This function will process a batch of customer CDR. If
--you supply the batch_id parameter, it will process that batch. If you do not
--then it will choose the oldest batch that has not received in any new records
--in the last 10 seconds.
--Note: If a CDR batch gets borked, you can resubmit it and Rain Man will clear out the 
--previous entries for that batch automatically.
